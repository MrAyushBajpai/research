datasets.py
-----------
Downloads benchmark questions ONCE and caches them locally so that
every language condition and every run uses the EXACT same questions
in the EXACT same order. This is a hard requirement for McNemar's test
(which needs matched pairs across languages).

Cache location: data/cache/<task>_<n>.jsonl
If the cache file exists it is loaded directly - no network call.

Tasks:
  math        → GSM8k (openai/gsm8k, test split)
  commonsense → ARC-Easy (allenai/ai2_arc ARC-Easy, test split)
  code        → MBPP (Muennighoff/mbpp, "full" config, test split, 974 problems)

Fallback hardcoded banks (20 items each) are used when the HF
datasets package is unavailable or the download fails.
